# Solar Power Generation Predictor 🌞

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict whether future weather conditions are optimal for high solar power generation. By analyzing historical data—including weather parameters, time of year, and past energy outputs—the model identifies conditions with the highest potential for solar energy production.

# 🌟 Key Features:

	- Historical Data Analysis: Utilizes weather and solar energy generation data to train the model.
	- Predictive Insights: Accurately predicts conditions suitable for high solar output.
	- Decision Support: Assists in planning solar projects to optimize energy efficiency.
	- Environmental Impact: Encourages sustainable energy practices by leveraging data-driven insights.

# 🛠 Technologies Used:
	- Python
	- Machine Learning (Naive Bayes, Bagging, Decision Tree, etc.)
	- Data Processing & Analysis (Pandas, NumPy)
	- Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
 
# 🤝 Contributions:

	- This project aims to support renewable energy initiatives. Contributions are welcome to enhance its capabilities and features.
